## Challenge
Implement a multilayer perceptron from scratch, in order to predict whether a cancer is malignant or benign on a dataset of breast cancer diagnosis in the Wisconsin.

## How to Use It

### ➣ Make train
**Will train the model with the dataset**
``` python3.8 train.py DATASET_NAME.csv ```

### ➣ Make predict
**Will make a prediction based on the train network and the dataset**
``` python3.8 predict.py NN_FILE.pickle DATASET_NAME.csv ```
